# Tags CCs
A fully functional, customisable, and reliable tags system for your server. :D

## Features
- Integrated individual tag colours (yes colo**u**rs, I'm British)
- Easier editing
- Compatibility with `snippets` (see [Other Info](#Other-Info))
- Better DM formatting
- Faster fetching and saving tags

## Usage
The base prefix for the tag commands are a semi-colon `;`, this is embedded throughout the main custom command. Remember that the trigger for `tags-main.go` is **Starts With**, not **commmand**.

`;tagname` - Sends the specified tag

`;tag add <name/aliases:text> [color:decimal] [image:URL] <content>` - Adds a tag with the specified fields. Content is set as a required argument if no others are provided, but if others are, you can leave it blank.

`;tag edit <full-name> [new-aliases:text] [color:decimal] [imaage:URL] [new-content]` - Edits an existing tag with the specified fields.

`;tag del/delete <full-name>` - Deletes an existing tag. `<full-name>` has to be the full tag name, not an alias of that tag.

`;tag search <name>` - Searches for a tag based on the name or alias provided. This returns all similar or exact tag names.

`;tag list` - Lists all the tags in the server.

`;tag help` - Sends the Discord embed version of the available commands.

The `add`, `edit`, and `del/delete` sub-commands can only be used by the assigned roles in the main custom command. If you don't have any of those roles, the command is ignored. Additionally, you cant name you tag "tag", this is blocked in the code and will send a "No Special Characters" error. With the `add` and `edit` commands, if you want to skip or ignore a field, you can put quotes `""` in it's space and it will use it's existing or default value. For color, you can either put `""` or `0`, both will default to the black embed color.

### Reactions
- ðŸ“± - DMs the tag content to the user (mobile-Discord friendly)
- ðŸ—‘ - Deletes the tag message.

## Planned Features
- [ ] Snippets-To-Tags Modifier CC (PRIORITY)
- [ ] Support for hex codes for `color` field
- [ ] `;tag info <name>` sub-command (still being debated)

## Other Info
Regarding compatibility; if you previously used the **snippets** custom command from the YAG support server and don't want to rewrite them, go through the following steps:

1. Add the custom commands to your server
2. Add the [**`dbsetmap`**](https://github.com/TheHDCrafter/yagpdb-cc/blob/master/Crafter's%20db%20shit/map/dbsetmap.gotmpl) custom command to your server, made by [**TheHDCrafter**](https://github.com/TheHDCrafter)
3. Following the instructions for the `dbsetmap` CC, apply the Tags Map Structure to the Snippets Map Structure:

**Snippets Map Structure (JSON):**
```json
{
    "image":"image-url",
    "value":"snippet content here"
}
```

**Tags Map Structure (JSON):**
```json
{
    "author":"tag author",
    "color":0,
    "content":"tag content here",
    "image":"image-url"
}
```
4. In the tags main CC and reaction CC, change `tag\_` to `snippet\_`

Then you are done! I know this is a lengthy process and I am currently working on a Snippets-To-Tags Modifier CC that will do all the heavy work for you. :)
