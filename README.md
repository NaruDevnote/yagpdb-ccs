# YAGPDB-CCs
The custom commands posted here are for free use, however if you do with to support me you can rep me in the [YAGPDB Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/4udtcA5) or gift Nitro *if you're that generous*. My tag is **@Devonte#0745** (ID 622146791659405313) ðŸ˜‰

**I am currently taking requests for CCs to add to this repository!** See [Contributing](#Contributing) for more info.

## Available custom commands:

<details>
  <summary>Custom Mute CC</summary>
  <br>
  A selective channel mute custom command that works just like it sounds. It can be edited to also send messages in Mod-Log channels when used.
  <strong>Note:</strong> this CC is no longer supported as there are more efficient versions of this code. Eventually, when there are more CCs added to this repository, this custom command will be removed.
